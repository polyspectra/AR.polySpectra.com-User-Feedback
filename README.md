## How to Use [polySpectra AR](https://ar.polyspectra.com)
1. Go to https://ar.polyspectra.com
2. Use the "Open STL" button to upload your .STL file (or drag and drop anywhere). Just follow along with the demo file if you don't have a .STL file. 
3. Once uploaded, you can change the color of the part with the "Pick Color" button.
4. If you want to save the file and color to view later, on another device, or share with others, click Save. (Everything up to this point has happened locally on your device.)
5. Click the share icon to get your unique link and QR code, to copy to your clipboard or scan with your mobile device or tablet.
6. If you are on desktop, you can scan the QR code in the bottom center of the screen to load the website on your mobile device or tablet. Once a file is saved, this QR code will automatically update with the most recent .STL file and color settings.
